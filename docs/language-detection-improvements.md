# Language Detection Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Language Detection for Single Swedish Words**
**Problem**: Words like "Äldreomsorg" weren't being detected as Swedish because they didn't contain common Swedish words.

**Solution**: Added multiple detection layers:
- Swedish character detection (`åäöÅÄÖ`)
- Swedish service word detection (förskola, äldreomsorg, hemtjänst, etc.)
- Expanded common Swedish word list
- Default fallback to Swedish for Botkyrka context

### 2. **Enhanced System Prompt Instructions**
**Problem**: Gemini wasn't consistently responding in the detected language.

**Solution**: Added explicit language examples and stronger instructions:
```typescript
// Before
- ALWAYS respond in the SAME language the user writes in

// After  
- ALWAYS respond in the SAME language the user writes in
- For Swedish keywords like "förskola", "äldreomsorg", "bygglov" - respond in Swedish
- For English keywords like "preschool", "elder care", "building permit" - respond in English
```

### 3. **Intent-Aware Language Instructions**
**Problem**: No explicit language instruction passed to Gemini based on detection.

**Solution**: Added language-specific instructions in the intent analysis:
```typescript
LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION: The user wrote in ${detectedIntent.language}. You MUST respond in ${detectedIntent.language}.
${detectedIntent.language === 'swedish' ? 'Svara på svenska.' : ''}
${detectedIntent.language === 'english' ? 'Respond in English.' : ''}
```

### 4. **Improved URL Rendering**
**Problem**: URLs were being cut off at periods and special characters.

**Solution**: Enhanced URL regex pattern:
```typescript
// Before
/(https?:\/\/[^\s\.,;!?]+)/g

// After  
/(https?:\/\/[^\s]+)/g
```

## Testing Results Expected

With these improvements, you should now see:

1. **"Äldreomsorg"** → Detected as Swedish, responds in Swedish
2. **"elder care"** → Detected as English, responds in English  
3. **"förskola"** → Detected as Swedish, responds in Swedish
4. **URLs** → Fully clickable without truncation

## How to Test

Try these specific examples:
```
Äldreomsorg
förskola  
bygglov
hemtjänst
elder care
preschool
building permit
```

Each should:
1. Detect the correct language in console logs
2. Respond in that same language
3. Show appropriate confidence scores
4. Provide relevant links

## Additional Improvements Made

- Added comprehensive Swedish service vocabulary
- Enhanced confidence scoring for service-specific terms
- Better handling of Swedish characters (å, ä, ö)
- More robust fallback to Swedish for municipal context
- Improved link prioritization based on query type

The system should now be much more reliable at detecting Swedish service terms and responding appropriately in Swedish from the first interaction.
